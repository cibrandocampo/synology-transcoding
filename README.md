# Synology transcoder optimizator

## Small optimizations to improve the transcoding quality 

By default, the NAS transcodes videos at 15fps, with a resolution of 720p and a bitrate of 2.5Mbps. Which makes the video look bumpy.

This small plugin is developed to optimize it and be able to configure it.
